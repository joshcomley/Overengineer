Coding is a Russian roulette of the keyboard.

As a software developer, you have a single gun with two very different barrels you have to fire out of.

In one barrel, you have your own ingenuity. You have a blank canvas and can invent crazy, weird and wonderful solutions to any problem. And your solution might be as wildly different to another persons as their taste in wallpapers might be to yours. The contours of your mind work in mysterious ways that even you cannot quite fathom, yet somehow code pours out, a digital engine is constructed and the ignition lit. And when that engine delivers its desired combustion, delight like no other engulfs your every breath of exaltation.

In the other barrel lies a bullet that no matter where you aim, fires at yourself. With this bullet, ingenuity is no protection or weapon. For this bullet you fire at your worst possible enemy when you are coding: someone else's crazy, weird and wonderful solution. Their mysterious brain contours. Someone else's code that poured out of someone else's mind that that someone else themselves also couldn't quite fathom. And now you're expected to. This is when you have to make your code talk to someone else's code. You can't be smart, you simply have to play psychologist to a brick and try to work out exactly what their code is doing and why. And depending on who wrote it, you might find that the reason why your button is not blue when the window is maximised is not because of any logical fault of your own; it is of the entirely unpredictable and impossible to guess fault in a contour of someone else's thought when they slipped a bug into their part of your software.

Maybe it's a bug in a web browser. Maybe it's just a perfectly functional but impossibly complex system you that need to navigate.

Who knows.

But this is generally the source of the 80/20 rule in development; that you get 80% of the way in 20% of the time, and the last 20% of the problem takes 80% of the time. Sometimes it's 90/10. Sometimes it's 99/1.

But this is where, coding frustrations aside, the true beauty of what you are probably reading this off shines.

Coding and engineering is like art; there are an infinite amount of ways to solve any given problem. And no one can predict art. And some art is ugly to all but the creator**.

When you sit at your computer, be it Windows, Linux, Apple, iOS, Android, whatever - you are looking at the artwork of not a few, not tens, not hundreds and not even thousands but hundreds of thousands of people all, somehow, just about working together.

From the thousands and thousands of people that all contributed to the code of the thousands of tiny applications that make up your computer's configuration right now, to the thousands and thousands of engineers who designed and evolved over the years the hardware it's running on, to the, er, designers who designed the casing of your phone/laptop/PC - all of these people's combined efforts are *somehow* coming together and holding hands and getting along, more or less without glitch.

Code and engineering by people of all languages, colours, gender, orientation and even the French. Computer software and hardware combined is the least racist, least xenophobic and most harmonious world there is. The ARM chip that might well be running your phone is only possible due to work by this wonderful woman in the 19XXs. Your screen only lights up because of these awesome guys. If you are using a mouse, you owe a huge amount to this guy. The internet you probably read this off is thanks to these guys and this guy and some others in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.

But it is beyond that. This isn't just an evolution of ideas that you are staring at; of course one could apply that logic to any topic of engineering.

Instead, you are reading this simple article on the result of hundreds of thousands of mind's work. Lines of code written thirty years ago will still be buried somewhere in your machine.

The harmony in front of you is not just of work *inspired* by so many thousands of people; it truly is, live, the direct work on hundreds of thousands of people just working together doing millions of things every minute to make all of this happen. Your virus protection. Your browser. Your operating system. Your hard disk. Your internet connection. Your wifi. Even your power cable. All of it. All of that right now has live human hours behind it from hundreds of thousands of different humans, not including the humans that their work was inspired by or evolved from.

Your computers are an orchestra of ingenuity working constantly and 99.9999999% without bum notes.

Unless you printed this out, you are looking at the greatest, global, collaborative piece of art in the whole history of human kind.
